2
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.000
What if learning could come to life?

3
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What if it could follow you? Wherever you go.

4
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What if it could take you to new places?

5
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:53.860
To see new things, new possibilities, and see things from an entirely new

6
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.000
perspective.

7
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Welcome to Degreed Vision, where you can see possibility become reality.

8
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
[Music]

9
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Mastering a skill is a powerful thing.

10
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.160
We live in a world where the companies that win, the people who excel, and the

11
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.000
markets that grow

12
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
continue to be defined by those that make the most of modern skills.

13
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.270
Yet only 12% of leaders say they have the skills they need to drive the

14
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.000
innovation they want.

15
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We see technology transforming science with computational biology,

16
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.500
Gen AI finally getting us our driverless cars, and data changing even simple

17
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.000
things

18
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
like how each of us summarizes the next long email.

19
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Changes everywhere, and we are all struggling to keep up.

20
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But sometimes we forget just how novel the speed of changes today.

21
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Civilization is only about 6,000 years old, and for context, it took 5,700

22
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
years to get the first mass produced textbook.

23
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
That's the beginning of the modern skill building era.

24
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.670
And then for about 300 years after that, the way we developed skills didn't

25
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.000
really change.

26
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.630
When my parents grew up and wanted to get ready for their careers, they got on

27
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.000
trains and traveled to build skills in centers of learning.

28
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.160
The pace of change was slow, so it was okay that the tools they had were very

29
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.000
limited.

30
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Today it's an entirely different story.

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We operate in a world where expertise is everywhere.

32
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's not just at schools or workplaces. It's captured on YouTube in podcasts,

33
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
in chat threads.

34
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.120
For us, all we need to do is formulate a question, and the internet can return

35
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.000
the resources we need to develop a skill.

36
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.350
But the unbelievable thing is that 20 years after the revolution in how

37
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.000
knowledge and skills are developed based on the internet,

38
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
everything is changing again.

39
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
For those entering today's workforce, the story will be totally different.

40
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
With gains in artificial intelligence, for the first time we can imagine

41
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
putting the world's greatest tutor in the pocket of every learner,

42
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.620
we couple nearly infinite content with nearly infinite opportunities for

43
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.000
personalization.

44
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.200
For every industry, for every corporation, and for every individual, the

45
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.000
possibilities are endless.

46
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
One second.

47
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Maestro, how'd I do?

48
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
No formalities, shall we jump right in?

49
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Yes, sorry for that. Go ahead.

50
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.520
Well, Max, I'd say you did well. There were some areas that you might want to

51
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.000
improve.

52
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You built good context by talking about how fast the world is moving.

53
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.500
You also made this very personal by tying it to your parents, your life, and

54
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.000
today's workforce.

55
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You didn't stumble, and it was easy to understand what you said.

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Good, but what could I improve?

57
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.030
In this attempt, you didn't bring up that the pace of change is accelerating,

58
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.000
not only for learning technology, but across industries.

59
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.260
You also didn't mention how much more productive the world has become with

60
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.000
every step change in humanity's ability to learn.

61
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Without that realization, people might be scared instead of excited.

62
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.560
If you'd like, I could recommend some content that helps capture both the pace

63
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.940
of change and also some videos from AI researchers talking about the potential

64
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.000
gains of this AI revolution.

65
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Sure, pin 'em.

66
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.180
Quick sidebar. When Degreed is my coach, the good news is that I can couple the

67
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.000
endless opportunities to improve with the resources to make it happen.

68
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Degreed exists because the world is changing fast.

69
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.480
Since our founding, we've worked to make Degreed the platform for how skills

70
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.000
would be recognized and rewarded regardless of where they were created.

71
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.190
In an institution of higher learning, through an online course or video, or on

72
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.000
the job.

73
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.120
The reason Dave and Eric set out on this path was because they predicted the

74
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.000
massive shifts in how the world works.

75
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.590
Unfortunately, even today, most learning software remains inflexible, optimized

76
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.000
to check a box on learning requirements.

77
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.760
Our team built the only learning platform designed to drive workforce

78
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.000
transformation, not workforce requirements.

79
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.390
We started by helping the world bring together and curate all of their sources

80
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.000
of content in a way that delighted learners.

81
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.480
We added capabilities around skills management early on in our journey so

82
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.960
people could get more personalized learning based on what they knew and who

83
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.000
they were.

84
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
We built capabilities to strengthen reporting, organizational administration,

85
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.090
and better connect our platform to the core systems that powered our customers'

86
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.000
business.

87
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.490
We delivered this all on one consistent platform, one data model, one

88
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.000
integration layer, and one world-class experience.

89
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.520
But the work isn't done. The world is moving faster than ever. In today's world

90
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.480
, a research scientist needs to know Python as much as they need to know lab

91
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.000
research methods.

92
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.800
A marketing professional needs the skills to prompt a generative AI system to

93
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.000
test new ideas.

94
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.140
Leaders need to be able to understand and interpret data with the same savv

95
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.000
iness of skill that they built in subjects like communications.

96
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.910
The exciting news is that the tools we can deploy to build skills are improving

97
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.000
at an even faster rate than the pace of change.

98
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.520
Today at Vision, you're going to get a glimpse of how we see the world and what

99
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.000
we plan to do to help you take advantage of this moment of innovation.

100
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.830
Our aspiration is to make it simpler, faster, and more delightful for Degreed to

101
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.000
help you turn the talent you have into the talent you need.

102
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And let me give you the cliff notes. At the core of it all is our platform.

103
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.980
We believe that to deliver transformation every company needs to be able to

104
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.000
pinpoint needs, personalize development, and measure change.

105
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.120
That is what Degreed is designed to do. Degreed skills technology is built to

106
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.690
create an actionable view on your organization's needs and pinpoint development

107
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.000
opportunities for each learner.

108
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.570
Like with our approach to content, we don't believe that any one technique or

109
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.000
skill technology will rule them all.

110
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.970
It's our job to synthesize skill data from a variety of vendors, drive

111
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.660
inference from across your environments, and synchronize all that information

112
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.000
with the systems that matter most in your landscape.

113
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.690
From there, you can change your workflows with confidence with our next Degreed

114
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.000
skills released in December, which you'll hear a lot more about later today.

115
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.690
We're excited that you can now manage all that data in whatever skills taxonomy

116
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.000
you select.

117
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.740
The byproduct of pinpointing your needs through this data is that Degreed can

118
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.000
now serve the right learning to the right learner at the right time.

119
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
This has been core to our mission since day one.

120
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.940
To drive the most engagement with development opportunities, we have always

121
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.000
helped you meet your learners where they are.

122
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.010
We deliver Degreed across the web on Android and iOS through browser extensions

123
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.000
and in Slack and Teams.

124
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.510
And now we are excited to extend our chat capabilities to support learners in

125
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.000
other co-pilots and chatbots.

126
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.570
But the data we have also confirms that not all skill building can happen in a

127
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.000
chat thread or across a three minute video.

128
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Our platform was designed to recognize and accommodate that.

129
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's why we deliver deep skill building experiences in the form of academies.

130
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.260
And I'm happy to announce the Degreed Academies will now be fully integrated

131
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.000
into the platform in this month's major release.

132
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.260
Flexibility to deliver programs across the short, medium and long arcs of

133
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.000
learning gives you the best opportunity to transform your business quickly.

134
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.960
No conversation about personalized development, however, would be complete

135
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.000
without AI.

136
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.690
Our investments into automation and a refreshed user experience lay the

137
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.000
foundation for everything that succumbed in an AI first world.

138
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.630
And we couldn't be more excited to use new technologies to deliver the most

139
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.000
personalized learning you can imagine.

140
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
You'll spend some more time with Maestro today, but imagine it.

141
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
AI agents tuned for every learning experience.

142
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.590
For the first time in history, AI makes it possible to teach to every

143
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.000
individual at infinite scale.

144
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.550
We've started to show the possibilities through the launch of our very public

145
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.000
Degreed Experiments.

146
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Thousands of you have already engaged with them.

147
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And the energy is only building. It is awesome to see.

148
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But the story of Degreed wouldn't be complete without one more pillar.

149
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Learning has always suffered from a lack of measurable ROI.

150
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.460
This gap is why we spend magnitude more educating our youth before they reach

151
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.000
the workforce than they do afterwards.

152
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.500
And this is true even in the face of growing lifetimes, changing employment

153
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:50.000
models and technical skills that come and go faster than ever before.

154
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.220
With analytics, badging, and integration into data warehouses, and a slew of

155
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.000
new benchmarking capabilities,

156
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.280
Degreed is bringing the tools your team needs to demonstrate learning ROI to

157
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.000
your organization.

158
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Degreed helps you understand what to focus on.

159
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.200
Deliver the learning experiences to address those needs and now gives you the

160
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.000
capability to not only measure activity, but also to see the impact.

161
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.610
So far the feedback from our customers using our new benchmarking and learning

162
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.000
analytics capabilities has been phenomenal.

163
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I'd encourage everyone to try them out.

164
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Together, we will make transformation possible.

165
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
We'll build opportunity for every learner and success for every organization.

166
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Pinpoint needs, personalized development, measure change.

167
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.010
I gave you a bit of a teaser, but we haven't even gotten going. Welcome to

168
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.000
Vision.

169
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I might be biased, but since skills is my love language, I don't think there is

170
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
a more exciting topic to start vision off with than skills.

171
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.770
Skills are all the rage in the industry today, but at Degreed, we were into

172
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.000
skills before they were cool.

173
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.320
Degreed has been on skills to deliver a better learning experience for nearly a

174
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.000
decade.

175
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.650
Our skill assessments have helped organizations assess, track and understand

176
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.000
their team skills.

177
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.400
To date, we have collected nearly 50 million skill assessments in Degreed, and

178
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.000
that number climbs every day.

179
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.570
We've parsed and inferred skill data not as a money making product, but as a

180
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.000
way to make learning more impactful.

181
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.380
And we've introduced Skill Coach to help customers use skills to drive more

182
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.000
meaningful development conversations.

183
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.220
Since starting, we've helped more than four million learners evaluate their

184
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.000
skills.

185
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
But the problem today is that the skills landscape is messy.

186
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
With everyone using the same buzzwords, it's hard to tell what people do.

187
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Most vendors focus on extracting data and analytics.

188
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Few vendors help you not only get insight, but also take action, not us.

189
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
For Degreed, skills data has always been the fuel that powers workforce change.

190
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Skills data helps us personalize learning and deliver better outcomes.

191
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.890
The most powerful thing about a great teacher, a great mentor, or a great boss

192
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.000
is their care.

193
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Their empathy for your situation, their understanding of your challenges.

194
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.360
But until now, it's been impossible to deliver this type of understanding at

195
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.000
scale.

196
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.430
You have to balance a desire for great learning outcomes with the reality of

197
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.000
budget requirements.

198
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
In the end, you compromise.

199
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Skills data makes personalized learning at scale a possibility.

200
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The problem is that it's tough to take advantage.

201
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.340
Skills data comes from all over in all different formats and requires some real

202
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.000
data science to harness.

203
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
That's why every customer we speak with has the same question.

204
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Can you help us make this simple?

205
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.750
In March, we release capabilities to allow our customers to adjust and normal

206
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.000
ize their rating systems across skill data providers.

207
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We also set our sights on a broader ambition.

208
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.410
Today, we are announcing our next major step by adding three major capabilities

209
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.000
into Degreed Skills.

210
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.110
Many of you want to use the skills taxonomies you've built for your

211
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.000
organizations to manage your learning programs.

212
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Beginning in December, we'll allow you to do just that.

213
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.850
Bring your organizational skills to the table and we will normalize all the

214
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:47.000
data from Degreed, our content providers, and your core HR systems against them.

215
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You choose one skills taxonomy, we'll make it all work together.

216
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Frankly, anyone with enough compute power can do that.

217
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.830
But with our December release, we will also begin customizing the front end of

218
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.000
Degreed based on your language.

219
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Our search, recommendations, and inference will drive off your taxonomy.

220
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.330
Degreed Skills becomes an engine to configure your Degreed experience in real

221
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.000
time.

222
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
When you press publish, your entire Degreed instance transforms.

223
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.320
Finally, we're making it easier to understand by changing the name to Skills

224
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.000
Plus.

225
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We're doing this to eliminate any confusion.

226
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.180
If you're a Degreed customer for years and happy with our taxonomy, our

227
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.000
assessments, and our current skills suggestions,

228
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.890
all the skills technology that you're used to will stay available at your

229
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.000
fingertips.

230
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
With Skills+, you set the taxonomy.

231
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.880
You integrate the systems that matter, you identify the skills that matter most

232
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.000
, and how your organization wants to evaluate those skills.

233
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.210
You set up the processes to keep skills data fresh, and you choose the balance

234
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.000
between inference, input, and assessment.

235
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Let me show you what this looks like in action.

236
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Managing Skills across systems today is an incredibly daunting task.

237
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.460
To work with our content partnered, Degreed tracks and maps more than 200,000

238
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.000
distinct skill labels.

239
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
The average Degreed customer integrates with over 30 other solutions.

240
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.470
Notice here on the screen that you can see a pretty typical Degreed integration

241
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.000
setup.

242
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Skill data everywhere.

243
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.460
When we release the first version of Skills+ in March, we laid the

244
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:31.100
foundation for you to create a baseline of common definitions of skill levels

245
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.000
across your organization, and within the Degreed platform.

246
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.720
Enterprises worldwide are already using the solution in production, preparing

247
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.000
for future releases that will tackle the skills challenge even more.

248
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.370
With our next release, we're adding functionality to ingest, clean, update, and

249
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:55.290
map skills to users, content, and operations where your employees actually

250
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.000
engage in upskilling.

251
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.380
Here, I've navigated to Skills+, where you can see we have already ingested

252
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.000
multiple skill sources.

253
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.250
We've heard over and over again that our customers want to be able to choose

254
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.000
their skills and how they are defined.

255
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
They want these skills mapped to their HRIS and they want control.

256
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
With Skills+, we do that.

257
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.130
I'm selecting the HRIS skill source as a primary to kick off the normalization

258
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.000
process.

259
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Here's an inventory showing all the data connected to Skills+.

260
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.330
The most important part is the skills your organization uses to drive employee

261
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.000
experience and ensure business outcomes.

262
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
That's where we want to make it easy for you to focus.

263
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.290
You'll note that our processing is done and we've got some suggestions to

264
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.000
manage.

265
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.750
Let's take a look at what our normalization process provides by drilling into

266
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.000
the skill AI Augmented Innovation.

267
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
We click through to see suggestions.

268
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.680
This is how we help enhance your skills with default descriptions, translations

269
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.000
across 10 languages, and default skill mappings.

270
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
In this case, I'm not going to choose the recommended skill name or description

271
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.270
because for our organization, AI Augmented Innovation is a critical skill that

272
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.000
we need our teams to develop to our standards.

273
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I will accept the synonym mappings.

274
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.560
These mappings are the magic glue that ensures better data, better personal

275
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.000
ization, and more relevant learning.

276
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.140
We're also enabling proficiency level descriptions specific to each skill so

277
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:32.500
you can define what each level of expertise means to your organization, and

278
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.000
automatically tag learning content accordingly.

279
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.790
With the click of a button, I've created the editable descriptions that will

280
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.000
power the experience throughout Degreed.

281
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.920
Now, I've shown a lot of administration, but the next part is really the

282
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.000
exciting part.

283
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.030
Like I said before, with Skills+, when you press, publish your entire D

284
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.000
egreed front end changes.

285
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.050
It's reconfigured so that your employees are guided to interact with the skills

286
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:02.000
relevant to their roles, their gaps, and your desired business outcomes.

287
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
No other vendor can do this, but Degreed can.

288
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Synonyms are merged to clean up duplicates.

289
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.390
A relevant skills are archived, but most impactfully for learners, the

290
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.000
experienced changes.

291
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.880
This means that personalized recommendations are tailored to each employee's

292
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.500
skill profile and proficiency, all aligned to the skills that are most

293
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.000
important for your organization.

294
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
See here, I've navigated to an employee profile.

295
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I see that AI Augmented Innovation is a new suggested skill for Jane.

296
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
She can add it and rate it with those custom level descriptions.

297
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.210
And, when it's added to her profile, she can see all the important data around

298
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.000
the skill that drives her experience.

299
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.010
In the end, this fosters growth and engagement leading to better outcomes for

300
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.000
your business.

301
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Don't take it from me. Hear it from one of our customers, Ericsson.

302
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
[Applause]

303
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Ericsson being 148 years old is truly changing every single day.

304
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
We started out as a telegraph repair company and now we're a powerhouse in 5G.

305
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.250
We have been on a multi-year journey to amplify our critical skills framework

306
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.000
at Ericsson, and for us, that's two things.

307
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.780
It's building critical skills systematically, and it's becoming systematic,

308
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.000
equally systematic, and putting skills to work.

309
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.120
I think our biggest challenge at Ericsson is we have, you know, 100,000 people

310
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.000
in 180 countries who constantly need to change themselves.

311
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
They need to change their skill sets and their mindsets, and they are busy.

312
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.120
Every single day, doing the work. People have always been learning at Ericsson,

313
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.000
but it's not always been as simplified as it should be.

314
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And it's not always been as amplified as it should be.

315
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.850
One thing we knew we wanted to do differently was to make skill building

316
00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.000
systematic rather than programmatic.

317
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.720
And that meant for us, it had to happen automatically, consequently, every year

318
00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.000
, no matter what.

319
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.990
And that's where Degreed came in. Degreed was this very necessary partner to us

320
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.000
in organizing our learning content.

321
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.360
Being a very visible, easy to navigate place where our experiential skill

322
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.000
journeys for all of our critical skills could live,

323
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.880
and that people could define their focus skills and use the power of

324
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.000
recommendations to build their learning.

325
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Everything is there.

326
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.400
People know that they go there first. They know that they can search. They know

327
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.000
they can filter and tag that search.

328
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
That's a big one. It's a basic one, but it's still quite fundamental.

329
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.830
People now understand that Ericsson's critical skills connected to strategy

330
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.000
live on Degreed. They know that's where to find them.

331
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.630
Degreed Skills have been a game changer for us, because suddenly they are giving

332
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.000
people what they always needed, which is a mirror.

333
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.540
The ability to look at their skill reflection, their skill signature, if you

334
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.000
will. Understand the skills they have?

335
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.460
Understand the skills that are essential to our strategy, but also bottom up

336
00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.000
understand the skills essential to their job role.

337
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.900
We are now able to tag and categorize skills that way, so that people can

338
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.640
search on a job role, can search on an element of our strategy and easily find

339
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.000
content from a variety of sources that maps to that.

340
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.350
With Degreed skills, people are also able to see where they need to go, not just

341
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.680
where they are, and they're able to quickly ascertain what journeys are going

342
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.000
to get them there.

343
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.800
So it's been a great amplifier and a great simplifier for us, but most of all

344
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.500
it's provided that reflection for people to know where they stand and know

345
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.000
where they need to go next.

346
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.340
We often like to say that skills are like oxygen. They are vital, but they're

347
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.000
invisible, and analytics is what makes them visible.

348
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.110
And that's where Degreed comes in. By being our learning experience platform, De

349
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.000
greed helped us make the invisible visible.

350
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.540
We could not have achieved scale, speed, or accountability that we have since

351
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.520
achieved without Degreed being in many ways the home of our critical skills, and

352
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.000
now the home of our job role skills as well.

353
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.930
I've been a Degreed for almost seven years, and I have spent countless hours

354
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.220
talking to our customers and partners about the challenges and opportunities of

355
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.000
using skills data to drive business outcomes.

356
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.770
When I see what's coming with Degreed skills, I see exactly what so many our

357
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.000
ecosystem have been waiting for.

358
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.120
It's an engine to integrate and act on skills data from across your learning

359
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.110
ecosystem. That alone would be enough, but I'm here today to tell you that

360
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.000
there's more.

361
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.660
Running skill-based organization requires more than just getting sight from

362
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.000
your content vendors and learning programs.

363
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.960
To be truly successful, you need to consider the full picture of skill

364
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:41.000
assessment data, HR system data, and even external marketing intelligence data.

365
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.980
That's why we're so happy to announce that Skills+ will help you normalize

366
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.000
and integrate new types of data into the Degreed learning environment.

367
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.490
Beyond the Workday and SAP integrations that you've been waiting for, we are

368
00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:01.360
proud to announce skill validation partnerships with HackerEarth, iMOCHA, 

369
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.320
Workera, and Skillable to bring the assessment data you rely on to your learning

370
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.000
environment and your leverage to drive change.

371
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
The average Degreed customer has more than 30 integrations into the system.

372
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.780
With skill validation and inference, that number will only grow. We are happy

373
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.000
to manage that complexity for you.

374
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
You can learn more about our integrations and integrations.degreed.com.

375
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.600
And today, we are also happy to bring in new types of skill data into the

376
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.000
Degreed environment.

377
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.670
One that I'm especially excited about comes from a new partnership we are

378
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.000
announcing today with Pearson.

379
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.540
Together, Pearson and Degreed will bring marketing intelligence data from Faethm

380
00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.170
directly into Degreed to help you make sense of industry skill data and

381
00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.000
future proof your learning plans.

382
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.760
Let's hear more from Vishal Gupta, the president of Workforce Skills at Pearson

383
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.000
.

384
00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Hello everybody. I'm Vishal Gupta, president of Workforce Skills at Pearson.

385
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.830
And I'm excited to share how our expanded partnership with Degreed empowers

386
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.000
your organization to future proof your learning.

387
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
As you know, AI is rapidly transforming the way we work. And one thing is clear,

388
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.360
the future belongs to those who are prepared with the right skills at the right

389
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.000
time.

390
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.050
Our collaboration with Degreed already helps many of you issued digital

391
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.000
credentials through Pearson's Credly platform,

392
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
recognizing key achievements and validating high value skills within the world.

393
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.460
Now, the Degreed skills dashboard will integrate Pearson's Faethm data sets

394
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.260
offering market insights into the most relevant and emerging skills across

395
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.000
industries.

396
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.790
Degreed users get compared their work for skills portfolio, industry benchmarks

397
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:56.000
, identify critical gaps and prioritize key areas for upscaling.

398
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.740
As AI continues to reshape the way we work, this partnership between Degreed emp

399
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.700
owers and ensures your workforce is not just ready for today, but for the future

400
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.000
.

401
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Thank you very much.

402
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000
I am so excited about Skills+ and our growing ecosystem of Skills Partners.

403
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
But that's not all we're here to talk about today.

404
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.420
This year we challenged ourselves to do more because this moment demands more.

405
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:28.710
Getting your data in order is foundational, but you don't drive change from

406
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.000
data alone.

407
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.300
You drive change by getting the right learning to the right learner as quickly

408
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.000
and easily as possible.

409
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.360
Meghan talked about how our customers are balancing the need to deliver learning

410
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.340
that sparks the curiosity of their employees with the need to drive skill

411
00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.000
development on strategic topics at scale.

412
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.310
This tension is real for many of you. It's why people cringe when they hear the

413
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.000
words "mandatory training."

414
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.760
The need to deliver wonderful experiences is often trumped by the need to push

415
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.000
out requirements to large groups of employees.

416
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.290
We asked ourselves if we could eliminate that paradox. Could we combine the

417
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:15.220
world's best learning experience with the tools required to drive strategic

418
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.000
change?

419
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.540
The answer we developed was "Degreed Automations," a no-code tool that enables

420
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.940
learning professionals to easily orchestrate the workflows that direct your

421
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.000
team's growth.

422
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.720
Every day, Degreed's platform observes millions of learning events. This

423
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.110
includes everything from the completion of a learning activity in Degreed to

424
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.690
the changing of a skill, to the changing of a job role in Workday SAP or Oracle

425
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:43.000
.

426
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.210
These events are markers that help to personalize learning experiences. When

427
00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:52.940
something like a promotion happens for one of your employees, you want your

428
00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.000
systems to adapt at that moment to the new situation.

429
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.070
Degreed Automations makes that possible. There shouldn't be a trade-off between

430
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.230
giving every single learner in your organization the experience they need and

431
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:12.220
giving your C-suite the control they require to bring your workforce into the

432
00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.000
future.

433
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.940
And because we've activated Degreed Automations for every LXP customer with the

434
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:23.000
newest release of Degreed, you don't have to make that trade-off ever again.

435
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.750
free IT, empower L&D, and balance the outcomes that you need with the

436
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:35.000
experiences your learners deserve. Check it out.

437
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.070
Degreed Automations takes the complexity out of managing your learning programs.

438
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.520
Our goal is to enable you to personalize your learner's environment to direct

439
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.390
your learners with nudges and automate the follow-ups that keep your programs

440
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:50.000
on track.

441
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.540
When we deliver standard learning experiences, we miss the mark. That is why

442
00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.850
some of you have built hundreds of Degreed plans or continue to manage learning

443
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.000
communications in a slew of SharePoint environments.

444
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
The way things are today is a mess. Let's see if we can clean it up for you.

445
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.950
Take the case of an employee that has just been promoted to be a manager for

446
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:14.460
the first time. A clear moment that matters. With Degreed Automations, we can

447
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:19.000
set triggers that transform the manager's learning experience on Degreed.

448
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.600
We can do it in a way that helps identify the skills and find resources she

449
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:28.000
needs to be successful. This client is syncing their core HR data into Degreed.

450
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.380
Let's use this data to target learners that have received a promotion and

451
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.830
create an automation. As an L&D professional, I want every new manager in the

452
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:40.000
organization to be met within upskilling opportunity.

453
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.210
Today to catch everyone, we tend to batch them together in monthly or quarterly

454
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:48.350
sessions. With Degreed Automations, I can start engaging new managers

455
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:51.000
immediately when their role first changes.

456
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.410
Without a single line of code, I can share relevant information and training

457
00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:00.290
resources in the moment they're needed. But here, the training we're sharing is

458
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:03.000
specifically designed for our HR leaders.

459
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.120
I can easily add a condition and target only those users. For our team, which

460
00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.410
cares a lot about ensuring new managers get enabled within the first two weeks

461
00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:16.450
of becoming a new manager, automation ensures that the right resources are

462
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.000
delivered to the right users at the right time.

463
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.300
But building a magical program requires more than just getting your employees

464
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:28.250
to start. We also want to celebrate their achievements. We used to comb through

465
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:32.000
completions and periodically send bulk follow-ups to our users.

466
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.740
Now with automations, we can offer congratulations in real time. I can design

467
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:42.520
an email that reaches out to each employee by name, making each message feel

468
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.000
unique and special.

469
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.890
Along with the congratulations, the email will also provide additional

470
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:52.000
resources tailored to support their growth and success in their new role.

471
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.430
If there were just emails, in-app notifications, and changing permissions, that

472
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.000
would already solve a lot.

473
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.580
But we're taking it to the next level of personalization with innovations we've

474
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:07.000
delivered through the newly configurable segment-aware home screen.

475
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.180
Part of the beauty is its ability to draw on what we call dynamic segments. A

476
00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.560
new way of defining user groups based on shared characteristics, not based on

477
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.000
management of lists that are outdated almost as soon as you save them.

478
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.200
As long as your core HR systems are connected, there are no more managing lists

479
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.000
involved.

480
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.320
With the introduction of our new homepage, we've also put the power of these

481
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:33.000
segments to work in modernizing the user experience that defines to greed.

482
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.080
When you log into a typical learning software, personalization outside of the

483
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.100
course carousel was typically constrained to a banner that your L&D team could

484
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.000
define at the top of the window.

485
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.330
Yuck. It might have been better than emails with bold subject lines for overdue

486
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:52.000
training. But it wasn't exactly desirable. With Degreedâ€™s new segment-aware

487
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
tiles, we're changing that.

488
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.010
L&D professionals can now quickly configure rules and build personalization

489
00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:01.720
directly in the Degreed's home screen that subtly pulls each learner in the

490
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.000
right direction every time they log in.

491
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
We just configured a simple rule and added a new tile.

492
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.240
Now when a new manager logs into Degreed, instead of seeing their company's

493
00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:16.480
generic page, the home screen adapts to prioritize the new manager experiences

494
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.000
when it's most relevant.

495
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Automations are magic, bringing personalization and execution together.

496
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.820
The average large company in the US saw training budgets decrease about 16%

497
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.710
year over year. With automations, we're helping you spend less time and money

498
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.280
on program management overhead, so you can spend more of your budget you have

499
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.000
on learning programs that help your people shine.

500
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.940
Automation takes the complexity out of turning the talent you have into the

501
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:46.540
talent you need. Let's hear more from BT about the promise of automations for

502
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.000
Workforce Learning.

503
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.760
BT, formerly British Telecom, as a hundred thousand colleagues up and down the

504
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.360
country and globally we are on a journey of transformation from a telecoar to a

505
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.000
technology organization.

506
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.130
As we evolve, sort of the skills and capabilities needed to deliver upon that,

507
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:10.000
so that's why an LXP with skills at its core was a massive investment for BT.

508
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.860
We launched with Degreed last year in 2023 in March and we launched with two of

509
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.390
our custom-facing units in Business and Digital. We slowly grew from there to

510
00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:23.000
where we're in a space now of a hundred thousand people on the platform.

511
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.860
Self-learning can sometimes be a bit of a lonely place and we want to be able

512
00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:31.000
to provide a journey for colleagues as they go through some of that learning.

513
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.770
Automations can deliver that personal experience that promotes the content that

514
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:40.110
's right for them at the right time. Some of the big use cases that we saw are

515
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.000
automations being used with was on boarding, especially.

516
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.490
We wanted to be able to engage with colleagues on their first day. We knew we

517
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.310
had that day and we know which part of the business we're at there in and we

518
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:52.000
can push content to them on that.

519
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.760
But not just on their day one, potentially on their day four, in day 21, and

520
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:01.790
when they log into my campus as well, which is our internal name for Degreed in

521
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:05.000
BT, they will say they might have an assignment or something will be shared

522
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.000
with them.

523
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.590
So immediately they're not just going into an empty box. There's something

524
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.000
there that's ready for them depending on where they work in the business.

525
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.900
We push learning to them at the point that we think they need it. Automations

526
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.000
allows that and it makes that possible because we pass in the HR data as well.

527
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.280
That's a massive win for our admins as well who don't have to manually find who

528
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.000
the right people are, who need the right learning.

529
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Automations you can set and forget and that's been brilliant for us.

530
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.900
From an admin side we used to handle that in a completely separate system. We

531
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.800
've been able to sunset that system now as everything comes from my campus and

532
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.490
because the emails and the notifications and everything is from the same

533
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:46.000
platform, users feel that the journey's connected from start to finish.

534
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.130
We can also set up different automations for different parts of the business to

535
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:54.410
engage and either promote different content, have different messaging or even

536
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:58.760
different branding, which is brilliant because it makes the new joiner to BT

537
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.000
feel really like they've had a personal experience on day one.

538
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:13.280
What I get really excited about is how it can be used to trigger off learning

539
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.370
interactions on the platform. Some of the stuff that you see in our day to day

540
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.030
lives where we interact with things like shopping websites where it'll notice

541
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.690
you've left something in your basket and they'll go, "Did you want to complete

542
00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:20.000
that checkout?"

543
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.830
We're using that kind of thought process with learning where someone that has

544
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.370
maybe began to follow a plan or a pathway and we can go, "Did you know that

545
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.000
there is more for you to do?"

546
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.180
So that might mean a completion of content, someone's followed a plan or a

547
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.000
pathway.

548
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.420
You can use that to then trigger an action which might mean adding a skill to

549
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.490
someone's profile or it could mean that we're actually asking them to complete

550
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.000
a further piece of content on their journey.

551
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.610
So those little nudges that are somewhere between push and pull learning, we

552
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.000
see automations play a massive part in that for us.

553
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.390
So we're really looking forward to working with Degreed in the future, not just

554
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.680
on automations, but some of the products and the functionality that they're

555
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.000
bringing to make learning even more personal.

556
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.800
Alright, we're not quite halfway through and even I'm feeling the need to catch

557
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.000
my breath. We've already covered a lot.

558
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.470
The world is changing fast, check, the seamless integration of academies into

559
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:19.000
the LXP, check, the announcement of Skills+, check.

560
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.960
We also unveiled new skills partners, some amazing new automations, and our

561
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.000
dynamic new home screen, check, check, and check.

562
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
So should we wrap it up early?

563
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Of course not, I've been waiting all year for what's coming next.

564
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.540
Why? Because this year, Degreed has gone all in on AI, not just any AI, but AI

565
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.000
designed specifically for learning.

566
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.530
Generative AI is the ultimate people pleaser, trained to deliver results to try

567
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.000
to make you happy.

568
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.580
But when it comes to learning, that's not always what we need. There are

569
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.000
significant challenges and opportunities.

570
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.880
First, AI is revolutionizing how we find information. Need to find a needle in

571
00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.000
a haystack? No problem for AI.

572
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.960
But the real question is, did it find the right needle? Did it search in all

573
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.000
the right places? Did it hallucinate this needle into existence?

574
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.910
And most importantly, does it even understand why we're looking in the haystack

575
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.000
to begin with?

576
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.630
Similarly, AI is helping us create new learning experiences. But how do we

577
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:31.570
ensure these experiences include the right challenges, opportunities to

578
00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:35.000
question, practice, and even fail?

579
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.650
How do we ensure AI is fostering real development and not just providing

580
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.000
entertainment?

581
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.730
Finally, AI is streamlining tedious administrative tasks. What are we just

582
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.000
doing the wrong things more efficiently?

583
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.950
How do we ensure that human insight, accountability, and values remain central

584
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:56.000
to the process?

585
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000
See the key challenge is making sure AI is accurate, effective, and purposeful,

586
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
not just appeasing us with its people pleasing tendencies.

587
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.400
At Degreed, We've been hard at work, testing new technologies, tuning

588
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.590
models, and experimenting with workflows, with hundreds of iterations, all in

589
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:22.280
the hope of unlocking better ways to support learners in their age-old pursuit

590
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.000
of knowledge.

591
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.260
Because simply having access to a powerful LLM isn't enough to transform your

592
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:35.540
internal talent. There's still much to be done to align today's technology with

593
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:40.000
the millennia of evolution that have shaped how we learn.

594
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.390
The good news, the opportunities are endless, and many great companies are out

595
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:51.000
there exploring this new frontier. We're proud to be one of them. And we hope

596
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.570
your has inspired, excited, and curious as we are to get a glimpse into the

597
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.000
future ahead of us.

598
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000
AI means change and change is learning.

599
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:16.710
We're a human capital research advisory membership firm, and we focus on some

600
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:22.000
of the most interesting problems in HR.

601
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.350
Our job is to provide high quality, unbiased research on things like AI, and

602
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.000
skills, and learning.

603
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:36.990
We founded Gretel in early 2020. The concept was pretty straightforward. Our

604
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:41.630
view was that as we fast forward, and we look at the impact of artificial

605
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:45.570
intelligence, machine learning, data science, the companies that are going to

606
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.480
be the winners are the ones that are going to have the most valuable insightful

607
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.000
data.

608
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.310
Runway has an applied AI research company building the next era of art,

609
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.000
entertainment, and human creativity.

610
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.290
Every vendor you look at is telling you, "We have AI." Our data shows in a

611
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:07.000
recent study we just completed that 90% of vendors said, "We have AI."

612
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.850
The pressure is the economic pressure to do things more productively, more

613
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:16.260
efficiently. You're seeing lots of activity being driven by those things

614
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.500
already. I don't think that ever goes away, especially when that costs come

615
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.000
down.

616
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.560
The promise is about increasing and improving the quality of people's work, the

617
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:30.000
quality of the creativity, creating new kinds of customer experiences.

618
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.240
We've certainly seen a pretty drastic evolution from last year to this year,

619
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.000
from a maturity standpoint.

620
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.620
And in some industries, the acceleration is directly tied to the fact that the

621
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.000
leaders feel like their data is their only mode.

622
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.350
So if they don't move quickly, leveraging the latest sort of generate AI

623
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:48.870
technologies, smaller startups or newcomers going to drop faster and move

624
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.000
faster, so that becomes a differentiator.

625
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.180
We know that a lot of people are experimenting with AI, but what's super

626
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.010
interesting about that as well is a lot of them are not telling their employer

627
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.000
that they're experimenting with AI.

628
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.950
One of the most interesting things for me is that AI is not just applicable and

629
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.000
all of the end user cases we think about today.

630
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.100
From chatbots to helping with customer service, to helping practice writing a

631
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.000
speech or writing a paper.

632
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.210
For me, what I find most interesting about AI is that it is applicable to every

633
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.000
single part of our business.

634
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.930
I think we're about to move out of that phase from experiment to what I would

635
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:29.000
call expand.

636
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.640
And expand means that one, we're going to see more scale of AI in the

637
00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.000
organization.

638
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.090
So instead of this individualized experimentation, we're going to see a broader

639
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:44.530
expansion of AI across the organization in a more coherent way and in a lot

640
00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:48.000
more clarity around what we want folks to adopt and do differently.

641
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
We see three things happening.

642
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.410
First of all, there are things that L&D teams do today that they can be doing

643
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.000
much more efficiently.

644
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
We're already seeing a lot of activity around creating content, for example.

645
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.990
The second thing is that we can create totally new kinds of experiences that we

646
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:05.000
can't do today.

647
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
So think about things like hyper-personalized career and development plans.

648
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
And then the third thing is we can automate entirely new workflows.

649
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
There were only just beginning to understand.

650
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Open-source models are going to get better and better.

651
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.060
And more likely, they're going to get smaller and smaller so they can be more

652
00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.000
functional.

653
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.770
I do think that it will enable us to have more time to think more critically

654
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:33.920
about what we're doing, to ask better questions, to connect with other people

655
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:40.000
more and better, and to hopefully be able to meet other people where they are

656
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
because we're not so distracted by some of these other things around us.

657
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.020
As we enter an era where AI and technology redefine what's possible, learning

658
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.000
becomes more important than ever.

659
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.730
I think you have two choices. You can either let this automate your tasks in a

660
00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:58.260
road, your stability, or you can look at this as a way to do your job better

661
00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.000
and more creatively than other people.

662
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:11.000
The first time I saw Degreed, it was magic.

663
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.240
A learning system that was built to help me find what I wanted in a way that

664
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.000
matched my needs and how I wanted to learn.

665
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.250
I'd been struggling through the world of requirements based enterprise learning

666
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:23.000
for years.

667
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.430
Then all of a sudden, bam, something new. At the heart of it was a recognition

668
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:29.000
that learning is a personal thing.

669
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
It's why we are so bullish on the AI transformation of learning.

670
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.190
Nothing is more personal than a system that takes your input, responds uniquely

671
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:39.000
, and guides you along the way.

672
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.140
It's also why as a company, we've been continuing to invest and stay ahead of

673
00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:47.000
the curve on AI, to drive innovation, and to do it in a responsible way.

674
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.470
In the last year, we've had some major AI advancements, starting with job role

675
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:57.380
to skill inference engine that makes it simpler and faster for HR professionals

676
00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.000
to build out their skill mappings.

677
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Now, when you add a role in Degreed, our AI can infer and suggest skills.

678
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.110
While it's hidden to learners, it means that their context can be accounted for

679
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.000
every time they log into Degreed.

680
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.950
We've also updated our onboarding flow and further improved the intelligence

681
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:19.880
engine that can comb through resume data and extract skills, experiences, and

682
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.000
proficiency levels.

683
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
With the simple resume upload, a profile can be built in seconds.

684
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.890
To make the Degreed experience richer or millions of learners, we've added

685
00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:33.880
skills suggestions into our profile screens, prompting learners to build out

686
00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.000
their profiles.

687
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.320
It's passive inference, combined with user choice. Behind the scenes, we used

688
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.000
our intelligence engine to begin tagging content across our platform.

689
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.590
In December, we'll add automated tagging of content by proficiency level, eas

690
00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:53.000
ing the process of finding the most relevant content for your learners.

691
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.470
And at LENS earlier this year, we launched Degreed assistant in beta, allowing

692
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:04.000
our AI to be used for exploration, discovery, and automated pathway generation.

693
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
But we haven't slowed down. Now, here at Vision, we get to the exciting part.

694
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.840
Over the past year, we've asked ourselves a simple question. What if all of

695
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:18.000
your employees had access to the best experts in the world for a set of tasks?

696
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.510
Subject matter experts, executive coaches, and content curators? How would they

697
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.000
change your approach to development?

698
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.720
At the end of our exploration was an answer, Degreed Maestro. Maestro is the

699
00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.000
next generation of the Degreed assistant.

700
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.730
It takes advantage of developments happening in AI at a frenetic pace, gains in

701
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:42.380
foundational models, new capabilities in voice, and increases in context

702
00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.000
windows.

703
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.070
When we looked at all these together, we realized that AI can become your

704
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:52.040
personal coach, and not just generically, tuned for the use cases that your

705
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.000
transformation requires.

706
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.150
Over the last six months, many of you have tested our AI chat with in Degreed.

707
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:05.890
As we explored alongside you, we realized the power of turning the one agent

708
00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.000
into a platform for many.

709
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.950
And if Maestro does just that, that'll be great. Let's jump into a quick demo

710
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:15.000
of Maestro.

711
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.480
Maestro is built natively into the Degreed experience you've come to know and

712
00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.000
love.

713
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.230
For example, Maestro can be put front and center on the homepage when the

714
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.000
learner first logs in.

715
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.670
By the way, this is just one of the many benefits of the newly configured

716
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:33.000
homepage that Quint showed you earlier.

717
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.090
Maestro also has a dedicated location in Degreed so that it can be accessed at

718
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.000
any time.

719
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.200
To start, there are several out-of-the-box coaches focused on career

720
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.000
development, leadership development, and skill review.

721
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.740
Soon, we'll add capabilities to tune coaches to fit your organization's

722
00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.000
specific needs.

723
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.760
What sets these coaches apart is they retain past conversations and apply that

724
00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.000
personalized contacts each and every time you meet them.

725
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Let's take a closer look at the skill review coach.

726
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.280
Here, I'm prompted to select a skill and I'm going to choose one of the focus

727
00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.000
skills that I have on my profile, which happens to be public speaking.

728
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And just like that, you're off to assess my current skill level.

729
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.130
Hi, Nag. It's nice to meet you. I'm here to chat about your public speaking

730
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.000
skills today.

731
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.020
Considering your role as a Chief Product Officer, I'm guessing you have a lot

732
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.000
of opportunities to speak in front of others.

733
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Can you tell me a bit about your experience with public speaking?

734
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.370
Yes, I do have to use that skill quite a bit in front of customers, in front of

735
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.000
analysts,

736
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.490
and in fact, I'm actually using that skill right now by presenting to thousands

737
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.000
of attendees at an event Degreed is hosting.

738
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
I see.

739
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.080
Wow, presenting to 1,000 attendees sounds impressive. How do you typically

740
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.000
prepare for such large presentations,

741
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.230
and do you usually handle it all on your own or do you have a team that helps

742
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:01.000
you out?

743
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.600
I do lots of preparation for the sessions. I try to keep the presentations

744
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.000
humorous and interactive and trying to know the audience.

745
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
I'm confident that the audience will enjoy what I'm sharing today.

746
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
That sounds like a solid approach, Nag. Keeping things humorous and interactive

747
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
is a great way to engage your audience.

748
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.350
In this small example, you can see interacting with the coaches just like

749
00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:26.000
talking to someone you've known for years.

750
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
The conversation is natural, quick, and informative.

751
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.740
For anyone that's had a coaching relationship in the past, you know a skill

752
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.000
building doesn't happen during the session.

753
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Instead, it happens between sessions.

754
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.130
To that end, after each coaching session, I'm presented with a summary of our

755
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:44.000
conversation.

756
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:51.040
Degreed content that I can further engage with, and a report I can export to PDF

757
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.000
for sharing with my manager.

758
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Switching gears to the career development coach.

759
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.910
Now, you can see how the coach remembers our previous conversations and has the

760
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.000
proper context.

761
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
So each time we meet the discussion is personalized and continuous.

762
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
And some days, you may not feel like talking to a coach.

763
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.350
And that's okay, because you can seamlessly switch between voice and text, and

764
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:17.000
the voice of each session is transcribed.

765
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
This also means I can refer back to past coaching I've received.

766
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
These coaches are stitched into the fabric of Degreed.

767
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
So like content, they can be included in pathways, plans, and even academies.

768
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.220
Now imagine you're kicking off an initiative at your product organization to up

769
00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:37.000
skill everyone about leadership and strategy.

770
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.580
To accomplish this, you've created a pathway with relevant internal and

771
00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.000
external content.

772
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
My stroke can become an always-on helper that can guide learners along the way.

773
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.200
Add a leadership coach to the pathway, and it can give you personalized

774
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.000
suggestions.

775
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.320
All with the context of your skills profile, past accomplishments, current

776
00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.000
learning progress,

777
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
and areas of interest.

778
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Everything in degree immediately becomes more personal.

779
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.180
One of my favorite parts of my stroke is when you near the end of a pathway,

780
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.000
you can immediately recognize your progress with the skill review.

781
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.660
My stroke can be the engine that recognizes skills and build workforce insights

782
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.000
for your organization.

783
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
We're not stopping here.

784
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.240
We're actively testing my stroke coaches for learning evaluations and practice

785
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.000
simulations.

786
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.710
And we are most excited to see how all of you can use our coaches and tune them

787
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.000
for your upskilling needs.

788
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.140
Maestro will be released into a beta program in October to a select group of

789
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.000
clients who are eager to co-develop with us.

790
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000
If you are interested, please reach out to your Degreed account team.

791
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
This is just the beginning.

792
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.740
Transformation never stops and we are excited to help you truly deliver

793
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.000
personalized learning with the type of skill never before possible.

794
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Alright, that is a lot of product. Skills, Automation, and now AI.

795
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.130
You might think we're done, but it wouldn't be a degree to end without talking

796
00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:03.000
ecosystem.

797
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.000
How's your close tech stack working out for you?

798
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
My guess? Not so good.

799
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.400
It is because a closed approach to building your learning stack may be enticing

800
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.000
for HR.

801
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
It often sounds simple.

802
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000
It can help short-term operations, but it isn't good for learners.

803
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.200
And it mortgages your future by denying your employees the learning they need

804
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.000
to keep your company ahead of your competition.

805
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.110
Whether it's integrating with skill vendors or the traditional HCM vendors, LMS

806
00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:38.000
, talent marketplaces, and content vendors,

807
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
we believe that you benefit when we take an open approach.

808
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
That approach has led us to partner with companies we compete with directly.

809
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Companies of all sizes and always advocate for an interoperable future.

810
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
It's made us some enemies, but it's also want us some even better friends.

811
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Let's hear from one such friend, SAP.

812
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:10.240
With today's rapid pace of innovation, every company wants to get ahead and

813
00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.000
stay ahead of their competition.

814
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.020
And that's why setting up a strong skills foundation and a solid learning

815
00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.000
strategy is so critical.

816
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.690
At SAP, we're continuing to build on our legacy in learning and talent with

817
00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:27.000
partners like Degreed.

818
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Helping to ensure our joint customers, such as BT and Ericsson, have the best

819
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000
content and tools to drive ongoing development.

820
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.370
Bringing Degreed and SAP success factors together, orchestrating across the

821
00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:48.200
entire learning and talent experience for complex workforce transformations is

822
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.000
what we are motivated to do.

823
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Integrating users, learning the 30-million content resources that Degreed has

824
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.490
with SAP success factors, talent intelligence hub to capture those skills with

825
00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:07.000
bidirectional integration is going to serve our joint customers.

826
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.240
We're excited to continue this partnership with Degreed and help our joint

827
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:16.950
customers build a skills foundation for the future and cultivate a spirit of

828
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:18.000
learning.

829
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:26.000
We believe learners benefit when we take an open approach.

830
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.230
It helps drive down the cost of learning because it enables a healthy

831
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:32.000
competitive ecosystem.

832
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.660
It also improves outcomes when everyone can use the very best tool or course to

833
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.000
learn what they need.

834
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Do you remember when there was only one real option for e-learning content?

835
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
It was the worst era of modern learning.

836
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.710
Now, you to me, Coursera, Pluralsight, Ted@Work, Masterclass, BookClub, edX, Open

837
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:55.370
Sesame, Get Abstract, a competitive learning landscape is a healthy learning

838
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:56.000
landscape.

839
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.800
And we haven't forgotten that Degreed's ultimate promise to the learner is to

840
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:07.000
enable this over your lifetime, not just with a single employer or provider.

841
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.080
Degreed's commitment to orchestrating an open ecosystem helps the LND industry

842
00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.000
move forward with an open approach that fosters innovation.

843
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
It is part of the reason we set up Degreed the way we did.

844
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000
I found a Degreed to recognize all of your learning and skills.

845
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.090
We are living through that shift towards a skilled-based world that I have been

846
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:33.000
dreaming about for the last two decades.

847
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.730
Degreed's skill journey is following a path we've seen before, as learning has

848
00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:41.290
gone from being a closed, often exclusive and very expensive experience to

849
00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:44.000
being a more open, democratized one.

850
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Consider the consumption of music.

851
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
You used to have to go to a store and buy an entire album.

852
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.010
Now as Spotify and Apple Music, you can listen to any piece of music you want

853
00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:55.000
when you want.

854
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.360
You can create playlists, different songs across artists and genres that flow

855
00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.000
together.

856
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Consider our TV experience.

857
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.630
We've gone from three channels on the TV to an explosion of options, hundreds

858
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:11.000
of cable channels, dozens of streaming services, millions of shows and movies.

859
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.900
Not to mention the explosion of content on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, all at

860
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:21.310
your fingertips, real time available to everyone, all enabled by technology, an

861
00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.000
openness and interoperability.

862
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Now, the same has happened in learning.

863
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Today, Degreed can curate playlists of learning content from across providers.

864
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.120
We can orchestrate personalized pathways and use automations to deliver

865
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.000
learning when and where you need it.

866
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.200
We can give you an AI coach that gives you feedback and support you need in

867
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.000
real time.

868
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.220
Now, there is an explosion of skill providers tackling different challenges

869
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:53.000
surrounding and developing the assessing and verifying of skills.

870
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.200
Are take has always been that it shouldn't matter where or how you developed your

871
00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.000
skills.

872
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.830
Our job is to enable an openness and interoperability across the entire

873
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:07.000
ecosystem as it grows.

874
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.520
This will enable everyone to walk the best path, use the best tools that work

875
00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:19.000
for them and is how we deliver value to our customers and to each learner.

876
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.870
You heard Deb talk about the importance of partnerships when it comes to the

877
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:25.000
next major release of Degreed skills.

878
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:30.110
In this moment, with technology changing everything we do, it is more important

879
00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:31.000
than ever.

880
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.580
Next, I will be sitting down with one of our partners to talk about how we can

881
00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.000
ride this wave of change together.

882
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:46.000
I'm happy now to be introducing another one of our friends.

883
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.120
And at moments where the competitor, Kian Katanforoosh, the CEO and founder

884
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.000
of Workera.

885
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.260
Kian is one of the best minds in AI in the world of corporate skills and

886
00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:57.000
learning.

887
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
So their platform, it allows you to assess and verify your skills.

888
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000
This relationship reflects the ethos that we have been talking about.

889
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.030
One where we are committed to enabling you to connect all of the best providers

890
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:14.000
and tools and solutions together.

891
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.450
To enable everything that must be true to unlock this skills future, we are all

892
00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:20.000
so excited to see come alive.

893
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Kian, welcome to vision.

894
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Thank you, Dave.

895
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000
And true Simon Sinek fashion, he says to always start with why.

896
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Give me the why behind Workera.

897
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
That's a great question.

898
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Why Workera?

899
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.750
When we started Workera, a lot of large organizations were telling us that they

900
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:44.000
were struggling to understand their skills.

901
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.310
Understand their strength and their gaps. Understand how they compare to

902
00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:49.000
benchmarks.

903
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.720
Where do I stand in the broader market? And it turns out that this measurement

904
00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:00.380
possibility is the tip of the spear of pretty much every enterprise talent

905
00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:01.000
strategy.

906
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.840
Because if you don't understand your skills, then you can't make the right

907
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.000
talent decisions.

908
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
You're essentially shooting in the dark.

909
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.380
You can't develop your people effectively. You can't match them to the right

910
00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:13.000
projects.

911
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000
You can't identify opportunities internally for them.

912
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:23.090
And so that was the why. Can we provide a measurement system that is reliable,

913
00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:28.010
accurate, fun to engage with for the learner, and that gives you something back

914
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:32.140
that is not pass-fail, but is actually extremely rich in the type of skills

915
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:34.000
insights that it can give you?

916
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.330
What has made Workera sort of a leader in this field and able to do this when

917
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:42.000
so many others have struggled?

918
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.580
Yeah, I think it's easy to build quizzes, but it's really hard to build an

919
00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:53.000
assessment that is valuable, actionable, statistically sound.

920
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.640
And I think part of the innovation that we brought to the ecosystem is one, the

921
00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.000
granularity of our measurements.

922
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.800
If I run an adaptive assessment on you, I'm going to start based on soft

923
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.770
signals that I have about you, maybe your title, or maybe your department, or

924
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:12.000
maybe yours of experience.

925
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.680
But those are high-level information that can help me start somewhere with my

926
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.000
adaptive assessments.

927
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.600
And then from there, I will use predictive capabilities to say, if David knows

928
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.000
this, he probably knows that.

929
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:29.240
And that allows me about an hour to give you a very rich set of insights on

930
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:33.000
that pretty large skill requirements.

931
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.660
So we all have a lot of skills, probably depending on how we define them,

932
00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.000
hundreds, thousands.

933
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:45.150
But in our daily work, most of us are probably using a dozen core skills, maybe

934
00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:49.230
two dozen, and then there's some ancillary or tangential skills we use on

935
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:50.000
occasion.

936
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000
And then there's probably some foundation of just a lot of skills.

937
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.720
How do you think about not every skill is created equal or we don't use every

938
00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.000
skill equally?

939
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.500
And so as you translate that into the work here, a platform, and approach, how

940
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.000
do you think about it?

941
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
A couple of frameworks for skills requirements that I like.

942
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.130
The first one is that skilled requirements are built by a variety of people. An

943
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:20.000
executive may define the skills that are necessary for an entire organization,

944
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
such as AI readiness, collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking.

945
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.110
A manager may define skills for their team that are necessary for the next six

946
01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:30.000
months to deliver the project.

947
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.840
And an individual may add to those requirements their own skills aspirations,

948
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.760
the things that they care about longer term for their career. All of that

949
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:43.790
together comes into a very well defined skill requirement that an employee will

950
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:47.000
be verified on, get feedback on, and then upskilled against.

951
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.480
The second framework that I think is trending right now across our customer

952
01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.770
base is the T-shaped career framework, where the horizontal bar of the T

953
01:00:55.770 --> 01:01:01.000
represents the durable skills. Those that are more foundational, as you said,

954
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
those that may last longer in terms of how much they helpfully are on the job.

955
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.190
And then you have the vertical bar of the T that are more perishable skills.

956
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:14.070
They may need refreshing on a very regular basis. I think innovation can only

957
01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:19.500
happen with both durable and perishable skills. They can, they happen with

958
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:23.560
perishable skill, but they continue with durable skills. If you don't have the

959
01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.160
durable skills, you will lack speed in terms of how much you learn over the

960
01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.000
future and you will not keep up with progress.

961
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:41.210
So I like that T-shaped framework. Does you zoom out and look into the future,

962
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.580
the impact that AI is going to have on learning, is it overhyped, is it real?

963
01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.000
You know, what's your point of view?

964
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:50.110
I'm an optimist. I'm not a doomer. I think it is underhyped. I feel that we've

965
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:55.560
seen the first few generations of large language models, sometimes called multi

966
01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.000
-modal models.

967
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.150
I think the next generations that are going to come in 2025 and beyond are

968
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:07.000
going to be mind-blowing and are going to revolutionize the learning ecosystem.

969
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.480
The reason I'm saying that is because we are seeing, for example, in the coding

970
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.320
space, software engineering, co-pilots, the ability for AI to generate pretty

971
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.000
amazing stuff that can be multi-modal.

972
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.820
I think for learning, it matters. Every learner is different. They will have

973
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:26.800
different skill sets. They will have different learning preferences. If you're

974
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:32.310
able to generate low latency, almost immediately, the immersive experience that

975
01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:35.000
they care about, how magical is that?

976
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.290
It's a game changer. I think AI improves assessments. AI improves learning. I

977
01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:45.650
mean, we all see in a few years that you can consider content generation to be

978
01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:48.000
almost immediate and personalized to the individual.

979
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.980
The potential of AI for our space is tremendous. There was no way that I could

980
01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:59.560
ignore that. That's why I spent my graduate school focused on AI. I tried to

981
01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.000
tighten it as well as I could with the skills ecosystem.

982
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.370
Talk to me now about the benefit to the individual, to the employee. As we

983
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:13.120
shift into the skills-based world, as they can get their skills irrespective of

984
01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.000
where they've acquired them verified,

985
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.910
what's the benefit you see? How does this change things for that worker, for

986
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:21.000
the employee?

987
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.730
The context of the job market is going to change. First, because the half-life

988
01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:33.150
of skills is going down, meaning that skills need to be refreshed constantly,

989
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:37.270
the learning velocity of an individual has to be high, if they want to compete

990
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:39.000
in the job market in the future.

991
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.390
The second aspect is we will live in a world where most people that are going

992
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:50.980
to apply for jobs are coming from a university, a job, a program that you may

993
01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:54.000
never have heard of.

994
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:09.090
The need to prove their skills is even higher than it used to be. I think that

995
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:09.410
people will have a variety of ways to prove their past skills, to prove their

996
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.800
future potential, through passive ways of measuring, that are continuous

997
01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.450
tracking, through active ways of measuring, that are in 10 minutes, 20 minutes,

998
01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:17.000
30 minutes able to prove a certain skill and have that digital badge.

999
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.480
I think there's going to be a variety of ways for people to prove their skills.

1000
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.530
I'm really bullish on the fact that, I hope in 5 to 10 years from now, we will

1001
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:31.550
have a very precise pulse of the supply of skills in the market, of the demand

1002
01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:33.000
of skills for skills in the market.

1003
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.540
Then we can turn the workforce into a much more fluid system that can reduce

1004
01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:41.000
unemployment among other things.

1005
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.330
As you think about partnering with Degreed, what made you want to partner? What

1006
01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:48.000
do you think about it?

1007
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.190
First, Degreed is the leading learning experience platform in the world. You

1008
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:56.000
created the category, right? You're the OG.

1009
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.090
With hundreds of customers around the world, for me, I think for a long time we

1010
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:09.150
were thinking what is work here as a unique specialty that it can provide

1011
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:12.000
effectively to the ecosystem and that can contribute to other platforms.

1012
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:19.120
For us, that is the key to the skills verification, very tight skills

1013
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.390
intelligence. I think we're really, really good at that. There are other things

1014
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:23.000
that we don't do as well.

1015
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.340
Sometimes I tell my team, if you look at the vendors in L&D, everybody will

1016
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.590
have dozens of features on their website. When you look between the lines,

1017
01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:35.000
there are one or two things that companies are really, really good at.

1018
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.920
If they can partner with each other, I think ultimately it benefits the end

1019
01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.000
user and ultimately it benefits the enterprise.

1020
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.040
I'm glad that you pushed for that interoperability, that integration within our

1021
01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.280
ecosystem, because ultimately if we can all provide our specialty to our

1022
01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.000
clients, then they're the winners in the end.

1023
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.640
Kian, thank you so much. You're someone I admire, respect, someone I am trying

1024
01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.990
to learn from, and from everyone at Degreed, we're very grateful for the work

1025
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:10.000
here at Degreed Partnership. Thanks for being here.

1026
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Thank you, David, for having me.

1027
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.620
It's awesome. So as we look ahead, so excited. I hope this represents everyone

1028
01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:21.690
's season at the push that we have to make the ecosystem work well, and to that

1029
01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:25.000
end we've got one more big announcement for you.

1030
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.530
Hi everyone, I am back because you wouldn't be at the degree event without even

1031
01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:35.000
more discussion about our ecosystem.

1032
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.040
And it definitely wouldn't be at the degree event without talking about

1033
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:43.970
learning content. Today, Degreedâ€™s connected to more than 3500 sources of

1034
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:48.890
learning content, providing access to 39 million learning resources in 35

1035
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:50.000
languages.

1036
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.570
But the world changed. The minute the AI started to enable deeper levels of

1037
01:06:54.570 --> 01:07:00.080
personalization. You started on Nags demo. It's not just a question of how we

1038
01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.290
deploy technology within Degreed, but also how we manage data across our

1039
01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:08.000
partnerships to enrich our AI.

1040
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.390
In the spirit of pushing the industry forward, we are taking the next step

1041
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:17.130
today by announcing Degreedâ€™s AI Ready Partner Category. A program designed to

1042
01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:21.080
enable Degreed customers to get even more out of the system they already have

1043
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.000
invested in.

1044
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.140
We have worked alongside some of the most established content vendors in the

1045
01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:32.120
industry to map the data, the flows, and approach to drive more intelligence

1046
01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:36.000
into the discovery of content you need at the moment you need it.

1047
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.030
Allow to excited to partner with simply learn at that that work and plural site

1048
01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:46.190
long standing degree collaborators helping to upskill the world's workforce

1049
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:48.000
across industry together.

1050
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.730
We are ready to bring our customers the next generation of in-app content

1051
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:58.000
discovery simply learn at that that work and plural site are providing degree

1052
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.110
deeper levels of metadata to help our AI deliver improvements in search,

1053
01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:05.000
recommendations, and inside of my experience.

1054
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.590
That means that you will be able to ask for information about your content,

1055
01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:16.000
whatever you work. We will bring this AI capability into the flows of work soon

1056
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
, whether you are in teams, in Microsoft Copilot or HomeBuildbot.

1057
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.340
Our launch partners are defining the standards that we will use across our

1058
01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:27.970
platform, bringing new levels of intelligence to every part of your learning

1059
01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.000
experience.

1060
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.850
By working across the industry to define a standard and process to enable

1061
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:41.000
semantic search, we aim to transform the world of content access once again.

1062
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.420
Getting ready for an AI first world, bringing new levels of intelligence to

1063
01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:48.000
every part of your learning experience.

1064
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.280
This moment is bigger than us. So take a listen to Krishna Kumar, the founder

1065
01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.000
and CEO of Simplilearn about why he is so excited about this moment.

1066
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.530
We are at the forefront of upskilling individuals on AI and we are used by some

1067
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:08.000
of the most transformative global organizations out there.

1068
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.370
While there is a tremendous amount of learning content available across sources

1069
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:18.500
today, we are on a mission to help individuals discover the content they need

1070
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.000
to create better outcomes faster.

1071
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.730
That's why we are so excited to be one of the Degreed initial AI ready partners

1072
01:09:25.730 --> 01:09:31.000
as they launch new capabilities to solve that age-old problem of this company.

1073
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.510
AI is not only a tool to automate tasks, it's also a tool to make existing

1074
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:37.000
processes better.

1075
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.910
When it comes to learning AI can help every individual discover more based on

1076
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:45.610
their needs. Through Simplilearn's partnership with Degreed, we have deepened the

1077
01:09:45.610 --> 01:09:49.000
integration between Simplilearn's content library

1078
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.660
by offering more access to Degreed's AI for search, discovery and

1079
01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.000
recommendations.

1080
01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.230
Now when someone looks to learn about a specific topic within the Degreed

1081
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:05.380
platform, they get more relevant recommendations of Simplilearn's learning

1082
01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:06.000
content.

1083
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.380
Degreed's search and Degreed's AI derives context from deep within the Simplilearn

1084
01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:15.000
library, helping users get right answers fast.

1085
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.440
Content you need at the moment you need. We are excited for the value that this

1086
01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.300
partnership will bring the joint customers of Simplilearn and Degreed and the

1087
01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:26.000
transformative learning experience that Degreed is bringing to the market.

1088
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.390
New technology, new opportunities to improve the way people learn and we are

1089
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:33.000
happy to see Degreed leading the charge again.

1090
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.250
This collaboration will offer customers a personalized learning experience,

1091
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:42.000
effective learning outcomes, equipping employees with job-ready skills

1092
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.390
and the competitive advantage they need to stand apart. Get ready for a truly

1093
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:49.000
revolutionary learning experience.

1094
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
One where learning is more precise to your needs, interests and competency.

1095
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
More relevant than ever before, more effective in preparing you for the future.

1096
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Fast.

1097
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.300
In the last hour, we covered a lot of ground. We unveiled Skills+. We

1098
01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:11.000
demonstrated the power of automations and we unveiled Maestro.

1099
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.110
Which brings new AI-driven learning experiences into the core of Degreed. You

1100
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:19.000
heard from our customers. You saw the product in action.

1101
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
And we talked about the vibrant Degreed ecosystem with our partners directly.

1102
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Our innovation is important. But so is how we are doing it.

1103
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.210
At Enterprise scale. Degreed is growing up. Vision is putting us on a cadence of

1104
01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:36.000
releasing new innovations at two major moments each year.

1105
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.230
LENS, when we all get together in person and celebrate as well. And Vision. But

1106
01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:45.000
the releases we walked you through today don't end here.

1107
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.330
In Quyenâ€™s demo, you saw our updated home screen. This is the user experience

1108
01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:52.000
transformation many of you have been waiting for.

1109
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.460
This user experience, which is entirely configurable and segment aware. So your

1110
01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:01.000
individual learners can log into an environment optimized for them.

1111
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.210
This is already in production with early access customers. In October, we'll

1112
01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:09.770
extend our early access program, giving all of you time to familiarize yourself

1113
01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:13.000
with the experience and the power of the new home screen.

1114
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.180
With each major release over the next year, we'll publish new cards that will

1115
01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:21.000
allow you to configure this environment to your organization's needs.

1116
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.310
And the best part about the new home screen is that we've coupled the launch of

1117
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:28.000
our new UX with our new Webhooks platform.

1118
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.390
This enables us to consume real time information from leading HCM and LMS

1119
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:38.450
partners to present the most up to date information from compliance training

1120
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:42.000
systems, removing the need to check multiple systems to stay on track.

1121
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.650
Many of you have been waiting for Skills+ for some time. Well, you don't

1122
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:50.800
have to wait much longer at all. In early December, we will deliver Skills+

1123
01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.000
with all the innovation that Meghan showed earlier.

1124
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.300
In the following releases, we'll add more advanced skill insights, including

1125
01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:04.000
bringing in Degreed benchmarks and labor market insights from Fathom.

1126
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.770
We're also doubling down on the creation of a clear integration framework so

1127
01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:13.600
that we can add new partners for skill validation and inference and you enable

1128
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.000
you to do the same.

1129
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.650
Even more, the Maestro demo I gave you isn't science fiction. What I showed you

1130
01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:25.000
is our own staging environment. We love testing AI across the company.

1131
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.670
Maestro is going to be live in beta for customers in October. Please reach out

1132
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.000
to your account teams if you are interested in getting involved in our launch.

1133
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.960
We'll also consistently release new coaches into production and give you the

1134
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.900
ability to work with our services team to tune and deliver the coaches you want

1135
01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.000
optimized for your environments.

1136
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.570
As we work on each of these, our foundation gets stronger and we haven't

1137
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:52.000
forgotten to invest in the core learning platform that you rely on every day.

1138
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.660
New automations will be coming with every release. We continue to invest in new

1139
01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:01.000
reporting, new configuration capabilities and even more integrations across

1140
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
different ecosystem partners.

1141
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.540
Finally, for those of you who have skill your teams in the flow of work, we're

1142
01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:11.690
going a step beyond Microsoft Teams. Our co-pilot integration is currently

1143
01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:14.610
being developed. Please reach out if you are interested in seeing this in

1144
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:15.000
action.

1145
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.690
What we ship is important but so is how we deliver that innovation. We believe

1146
01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:26.000
that every Degreed customer needs a foundation change that is rock solid.

1147
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.720
It's why we have stressed the importance of one platform, one data model and

1148
01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.210
one trust layer. No one wants the headache of mashup applications and

1149
01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:38.000
technologies. With a Degreed, you don't have that.

1150
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.010
We are also making significant investments over the next few quarters to

1151
01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.000
further reinforce our platform.

1152
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.940
In our recent July release, we delivered several key enhancements to the

1153
01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:52.150
platform designed to improve your experience and draw better outcomes. We

1154
01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:57.130
added learning data to advanced analytics, expanding insights into learner

1155
01:14:57.130 --> 01:14:59.000
behavior and program ROI.

1156
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.310
We introduced Degreedâ€™s AI SDK focused on delivering powerful AI capabilities

1157
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:07.000
that are built with trust and transparency our customers need.

1158
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.180
We launched Workday Integration with bi-directional skill-sinking and shooting

1159
01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:16.860
a seamless flow of data between platforms. For admins, we have rolled out skill

1160
01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:20.770
suggestions for job roles and Degreed admins to make it easier to align roles

1161
01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:22.000
with right skills.

1162
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.620
And we have enhanced segment administration, now supporting bulk updates and cl

1163
01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.000
oning for greater efficiency.

1164
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.860
As we continue investing in new experiences across platform, we are also

1165
01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:37.000
ensuring that our core capabilities scale with your needs.

1166
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.760
In October, we are adding even more flexibility to meet the growing complexity

1167
01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.000
of deployments.

1168
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.710
Our integration of academies into LXP ensures that deep skill building program

1169
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:52.530
benefits from the same reporting, permissions, content libraries and autom

1170
01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:55.000
ations that you already love from Degreed.

1171
01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.640
We have revamped our navigation for end users and administrations and will be

1172
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.000
putting this into early release and answering usability.

1173
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.840
We have unified segments and groups making administration easier and most

1174
01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.000
streamlined.

1175
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.940
In addition, you will see configurable branding, making it easier to manage

1176
01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.000
your learning environments.

1177
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.140
As we serve more mission-critical use cases, it's vital that we deliver the

1178
01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:25.000
enterprise-grade experiences your teams need.

1179
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.280
Over the next few quarters, you will see trust and observability innovations

1180
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.000
with trust pages and status pages for real-time transparency.

1181
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.810
Reponing innovations, including self-serve reporting, giving you more control

1182
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:39.000
over your data.

1183
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.540
Stability innovations to improve the performance and reliability of integr

1184
01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:44.000
ations.

1185
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.720
And support for custom security roles offering more flexibility in how you

1186
01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.000
manage access and permissions.

1187
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.760
This foundation ensures that all of this incredible capabilities work together

1188
01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.310
seamlessly enabling your organizations to scale, secure and optimize your

1189
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:03.000
learning ecosystem with confidence.

1190
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.020
Together, this is helping us to deliver a platform built for speed, scalability

1191
01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:09.000
and impact.

1192
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.720
Max kicked us off today by mentioning that this moment demanded a lot of degree

1193
01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.000
.

1194
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
The world of learning is changing.

1195
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.120
For the first time though, we have both the data and the technology to truly

1196
01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:27.000
bridge the skills gap in a personalized way at scale.

1197
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.030
But at the same time, the growing skills gap means that the world's workforce

1198
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:34.000
is under a lot of pressure.

1199
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.470
So, the importance of lifelong learning is getting greater than it ever has

1200
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:39.000
been.

1201
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.170
12 years ago, I started getting people's attention by calling out the absurdity

1202
01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:50.810
of when you get asked about your education, most people will respond with their

1203
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:53.000
decades-old credential.

1204
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.530
Now that we have all of the world's knowledge in our pocket and the world's

1205
01:17:57.530 --> 01:18:02.000
best AI tutors right there alongside us, this is even more absurd.

1206
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.870
I've told our team on multiple occasions. Now the innovations that we needed to

1207
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:11.000
deliver at Vision had to represent a step change for our customers.

1208
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
And I believe it is.

1209
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Now, the Degreed can help you get three jobs done.

1210
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
So the first is to pinpoint your skill needs.

1211
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.090
We give you insights into all of the skills data across the entirety of the

1212
01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:25.000
workforce.

1213
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.440
The second is to personalize each employee's development against their skills

1214
01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.000
gap.

1215
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
We enable everyone to take the action they need, where they need it.

1216
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
And the third is to measure the impact and the ROI.

1217
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000
We can help you evaluate your impact and adjust course along the way as needed.

1218
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.620
Over the last nine months, we've been working hand in hand with enterprises

1219
01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:57.000
like Ericsson, Capgemini, BT, HSBC, and so many more to deliver the innovation

1220
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
that's actually needed to help you transform the talent you have.

1221
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.300
And you saw the results today. We introduced new capabilities and a new name of

1222
01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.000
Skills+.

1223
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.740
For the first time enabling every one of our customers to choose their own

1224
01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.000
skills taxonomy and skill scale.

1225
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.250
And have Degreed to the heavy lifting of normalizing that data, synchronizing it

1226
01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:23.030
across your content vendors, and validation partners, and putting it into your

1227
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:24.000
HR systems.

1228
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000
We then use it to adjust your Degreed experience in real time.

1229
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.920
We unveiled new functionality from Degreed automations, which will help admins

1230
01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.000
do their job more efficiently and effectively.

1231
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.390
Not only helping them to just build campaigns and add access rights, but also

1232
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:49.330
now with our updated home screen allowing admins to dynamically control the

1233
01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:52.000
very home screen experience.

1234
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.550
The very home screen experience within Degreed based on the same engine that

1235
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:58.000
drives automations.

1236
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.200
And lastly, we revealed Maestro, the next generation of our AI, delivering fine

1237
01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:11.910
-tuned learning AI to help support specific situations in a learner's life, all

1238
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:16.000
embedded within the Degreed experience.

1239
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.750
There was also a lot from our open ecosystem partners. We announced new

1240
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:23.000
partnerships to help drive skill validation.

1241
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.710
We've established a new category for AI-powered content discovery, and you

1242
01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:32.000
heard directly from the folks at Workera, Pearson, and Simplilearn.

1243
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.940
Importantly, I hope that this reminded all of you that you aren't on this

1244
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.000
journey alone.

1245
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.150
We are all better when we collaborate, when we learn from each other, and when

1246
01:20:41.150 --> 01:20:44.000
we enable all of these systems to work together.

1247
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.610
We know that's what you all want and need to be successful, and we are

1248
01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:53.000
committed to leading an open ecosystem approach to workforce technology.

1249
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.250
We only scratch the surface today. We know that many of you will have questions

1250
01:20:58.250 --> 01:21:00.000
and will want to dive deeper.

1251
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000
We will be hosting follow-up deep dive webinars on all of these announcements,

1252
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.340
and we'll be sharing more information on how you can register immediately after

1253
01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.000
vision.

1254
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.640
And our one final announcement to share, we are excited that we will be back on

1255
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:17.000
stage in person at LENS this April.

1256
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:23.000
All of you are invited to join us in Orlando, Florida on April 15th and 16th.

1257
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.930
We have some really exciting announcements up our sleeves, along with engaging

1258
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:30.640
speakers, collaborative breakout sessions with your peers, where you can

1259
01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:34.000
discuss all the best practices, and we'll be having some fun too.

1260
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Registration is open, and we can't wait to see you there. Thanks everyone.
